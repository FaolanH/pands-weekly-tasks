#I learned how to do this through Datacamp, 'Working with Dates and Time in Python'

# Import date from datetime
import datetime 

# Initially I set the date, AI told me I could let the computer set today's date! 
#Create a date object - this would have to be changed according to the day it is 
#today = date(2025, 3, 8)
today = datetime.datetime.now()

#This step formats today's date as a weekday day (aka a number between 0-6 incl. 6)
day_of_week = today.weekday()

#Which day of the week is the date? The days start from 0 (Monday) and go up to 4 (Friday)
if day_of_week <5:
    print (f"Yes, unfortunately {today.strftime('%A')} is a weekday")
#for a weekend, it is a 5 or a 6, but this can be called else as there is no other option
else:
    print (f"Today ({today.strftime('%A')}) is the weekend, yay!")

#with a mixture of my DataCamp and AI to let me know which letter to use (A), we can see what day it is today
#AI Question:
#python datetime .weekday print as day of week
#AI_Answer
#import datetime
# Get the current date
#current_date = datetime.datetime.now()
# Get the day of the week as a string
#day_of_week = current_date.strftime("%A")
# Print the day of the week
#print("Today is:", day_of_week)
