# pands-weekly-tasks
### This repository is for the Programming and Scripting module in the Data Analytics Higher Diploma course. Worth 50% of the module, there were eight weekly tasks given to complete using Python (through VSCode in my case). 

### Here is a list of all eight tasks, with greater detail given below:
#### Week One: Hello World
#### Week Two: Bank 
#### Week Three: Accounts
#### Week Four: Collatz
#### Week Five: Weekday
#### Week Six: Squareroot
#### Week Seven: Textfile
#### Week Eight: Plot

#### Week One: Hello World
##### This simple task was the first one given in the module, a common introduction phrase used when teaching coding. The intended output for this module is a simple "Hello, World" phrase in the terminal.
