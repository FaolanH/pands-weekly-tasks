# pands-weekly-tasks


## This repository is for the Programming and Scripting module in the Data Analytics Higher Diploma course. Worth 50% of the module, there were eight weekly tasks given to complete by Monday the 28th of April 2025 using Python (through VSCode in my case). 

----------
### Week One: Hello World

#### This simple task was the first one given in the module; a common introduction phrase used when teaching coding. The phrase is then printed in the terminal

#### Output:
#### "Hello, World!"

----------
### Week Two: Bank

#### This task required the user to input two amounts (in cents), and the program output the sum of the two amounts in cents. 

#### Example Output:
#### Please enter the first amount (in cents): 123
#### Please enter the second amount (in cents): 654
#### The sum of the two amounts in euros and cents is €7.77c

----------
### Week Three: Accounts

#### This task required the user to input their 10 digit account number with the first six digits censored with Xs for security purposes in the output.

#### Example Output:
#### Please input your 10 digit account number: 1234567890
#### For security purposes, your account number has been redacted to only show the last four digits: XXXXXX7890

----------
### Week Four: Collatz

#### This task follows the mathematical sequence, which changes depending on whether the number input is odd or even. The output will show the numbers it takes to end in one following the sequence.

#### Example Output:
#### Please enter a positive integer (whole number) greater than 1: 12
#### 6 3 10 5 16 8 4 2 1 

----------
### Week Five: Weekday
#### This task outputs the day of the week, by reading in what day of the week it is. Each day type (Midweek, Friday or the weekend) has a different message associated

#### Example Output:
#### Yes, unfortunately Wednesday (April 23) is a weekday
#### Yay, finally it's Friday (April 25), still a weekday but nearly the weekend!
#### Today is Sunday (April 27) aka. the weekend, yay!

----------
### Week Six: Squareroot
#### This task takes in a positive number, and outputs the approximate square root using the 

#### Example Output:
#### Please enter a positive number: 45
#### The square root of 45.0 is approx. 6.7082

----------
### Week Seven: Textfile
#### This task reads in a txt. file and outputs the number of 'e' within the file.

#### Output:
#### There are 290 'e' in the loremipsum txt. file.

----------
### Week Eight: Plottask
#### The final weekly task imports matplotlib.pyplot to visualise data with a normal distribution (as seen in the output below)

#### Output:
