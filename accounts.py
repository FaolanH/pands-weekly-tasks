# read in a 10 character account number and output the account number with only the last 4 digits 
# showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
# Author: Faol√°n Hamilton

#Please enter an 10 digit account number: 1234567890
#XXXXXX7890
#Extra: Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, 
#comment your assumptions)

#Python lists on Datacaamp
account_number = list(input("Please input your 10 digit account number: "))
account_number [0:5] = 'XXXXXX'
#a mix of stack overflow which had converting strings to list led me to co-pilot for the reverse
#my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'] \n result = ', '.join(my_list) \nprint(result)  # Output: apple, banana, cherry
