#Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
#You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.
#I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).
#I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots. 

#I found an article discussing this, and re-formulated it as my own! This code is contributed by AnkitRai01

# Function to return the square root of a number using Newtons method 
def square_root(n, l) :

	# Assuming the sqrt of n as n only 
	x = n 

	# To count the number of iterations 
	count = 0

	while (1) :
		count += 1

		# Calculate more closed x 
		root = 0.5 * (x + (n / x)) 

		# Check for closeness 
		if (abs(root - x) < l) :
			break

		# Update root 
		x = root

	return root

#Both have a similar answer, but the AI's formula is shorter.
